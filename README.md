# Marketing-Campaign-Performance-Insights Python
This Python code performs an analysis of marketing campaign data using a combination of descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations. Here's a quick summary of its steps:

Data Loading and Basic Overview:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file using pandas.

The basic structure (first few rows, shape, and data types) is displayed.

Descriptive statistics for numerical columns are generated.

Data Exploration:

Unique values in specific columns (like Campaign_ID, Location, and Customer_Segment) are explored.

Counts of occurrences for categorical columns (Campaign_Type, Channel_Used) are displayed.

Visualizations:

Scatter Plot: Shows the relationship between Acquisition_Cost and ROI, revealing a negative correlation.

Bar Charts: Display average Conversion_Rate by Channel_Used, segmented by Campaign_Type, as well as ROI across companies and customer segments.

Box Plots: Visualize the distribution of Engagement_Score and Acquisition_Cost across different campaign types and customer segments.

Heatmap: Examines the correlation between Engagement_Score and Conversion_Rate.

Pie Charts: Illustrate the ROI distribution by Channel_Used and Location.

Line Charts: Analyze trends over time for Conversion_Rate and Engagement_Score across companies.

Histogram: Displays the distribution of Duration for different campaigns.

Geographic and Customer Segmentation Analysis:

Bar charts are used to show conversion rates and acquisition costs by location and target audience.

The distribution of ROI by location is visualized.

Pair Plots: Visualize relationships between various numerical and categorical variables, including Acquisition_Cost, Clicks, ROI, and Engagement_Score.

The code provides comprehensive insights into the performance of marketing campaigns, focusing on the effectiveness of channels, customer segmentation, and geographic factors.
